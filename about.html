<p>1. Despite being as white as a late-stage Michael Jackson, I am actually half Mexican. I have recently come to terms with being referred to as the &ldquo;Pale Mexican&rdquo; at family parties. </p>

<p>2. In college, my friends and I shot a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=LrAXDa4uHVI&rdquo;> wrestling movie</a> in my backyard. In between takes we entertained ourselves by recording ourselves rapping. Unfortunately, those raps still exist. </p>

<p>3. I once met a group of Malaysians in Rome who decided to sponsor my drinking for the night. The next day I woke up, fully clothed, in a bathtub near the Coliseum. </p>
