3. Since I don't have any photos (yet) I think it would be wise to change he
photos section into "Contact?" It would also be amazing to have an email address
linked to the site for example
Johnny@heresjohnnynava.com.

I'm not sure how difficult that would be.

4. I really like the logo but could we make it black and white instead of gray and white?

5. Is there anyway we could create a comments section for the posts. Maybe not
immediately but at some point down the road at least.

7. Id like to create a hyperlink that links the viewer to my Instagram and other social medias.

8. Would it be possible to allow people sign up for an email mailing list via
the contact page?
